  # The workflow should be run on a schedule using the 'schedule' event trigger.
  #
  # For more details on how to configure the schedule event, see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onschedule.
  #
  # Below are some options for different schedules. Running the tests every hour is recommended,
  # but every 3-6 hours is also helpful. Times are in UTC.
   schedule:
     # By default, the workflow will run every hour.
     - cron:  '0 * * * *'
     # Every 3 hours.
     # - cron:  '0 0/3 * * *'
     # Every 6 hours.
     # - cron:  '0 0/6 * * *'
     # Every 12 hours.
     # - cron:  '0 0/12 * * *'
     # Once per day at 00:00.
     # - cron:  '0 0 * * *'
     # Every 30 minutes.
     # - cron:  '0/30 * * * *'

  # or the commit hash for any other events.
